**Keyword:** man waking up by foggy window

### Image Prompt (888 chars)
A slim 28-year-old Vietnamese man named Minh with short black hair, faint stubble, and black-rim glasses sits up on a narrow bed in a tiny Hanoi rental room, wearing a navy puffer jacket over a gray scarf and dark jeans as he turns toward a single-pane window where thick winter fog hides the city beyond; the cramped room has pale peeling walls, a small wooden desk with a closed laptop and canvas backpack, and cold morning light spilling in from the window as the main source so shadows fall long across the wrinkled blanket. Medium shot on a 35mm natural lens from the foot of the bed, composed to include the fogged window and the desk in the same frame. Cinematic photorealism with blue-gray winter tones and soft diffused lighting that makes the glass look damp and hazy. 16:9 cinematic, 4K, no text overlays, no watermarks, no logos, no distorted hands or faces, no extra fingers.

A slim 28-year-old Vietnamese man named Minh with short black hair, faint stubble, and black-rim glasses sits up on a narrow bed in a tiny Hanoi rental room, wearing a navy puffer jacket and gray scarf as he turns his head toward a fogged window where the winter mist blankets the city, because the cold light seeping through the glass pulls his attention away from the cramped interior with a small desk, a closed laptop, and a canvas backpack. The camera starts in a medium shot with a 35mm natural lens and performs a slow dolly in toward Minh as he exhales and rubs his eyes, letting the pale window light remain the key source so his cheekbones cast soft shadows and the room stays dim behind him. Cinematic photorealistic style with cool blue-gray palette and gentle diffusion, emphasizing condensation on the window. Audio: faint wind outside, muffled early motorbikes far below, a quiet fabric rustle as he shifts on the bed, and a soft exhale. 16:9 cinematic, 4K, no text overlays, no watermarks, no logos, no jittery artifacts, no warped anatomy.

The camera holds a close-up with an 85mm portrait lens and makes a subtle tilt down from Minh’s face to the drink, letting mixed lighting from the cool window and warm interior bulbs create soft, believable shadows on the table grain.

The camera uses a 35mm natural lens in an over-the-shoulder medium shot and performs a slow dolly in toward the screen area, letting warm tungsten bulbs above act as the key light so his hands cast soft shadows across the keys, while cool daylight from the foggy window adds a faint rim on his jacket.
